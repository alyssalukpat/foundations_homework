Homework 1

1. How many accidents are in the file?
397.
    I opened the file and used cat [filename] to read the contents. Then, I counted the number of lines using cat [filename] wc -l and got 398.
    I assume terminal starts counting at zero, so there would be 399 lines. I subtracted 2 (because the first two lines weren't data) from 399 and got 397.

2. I want to know what companies were involved in explosions. Can you search the file to only show falls?
Yes! I'm not sure if you want me to paste the result, because it was long.
    I searched the file to only show falls using grep -E 'fall|fell' [filename]. This allowed me to search for the keywords "fall" and "fell" at the same time.

3. I would like a file of only 2017 accidents. How many lines is in it?
120.
    I used the command grep -c 2017 [filename].

4. What command would I use to show me ONLY the first line of the file?
head -n 1 [filename]
    The command returned this result:
        "Date of Incident ","Employer/Address of Incident ","Victim(s) ","Hazard Description ","Fatality or Catastrophe ","Inspection # "

5. How many accidents involved forklifts? Also, save them to a file.
12                                                                                          
    I counted the number of forklift accidents with the command grep -c forklift [filename].
    I saved the forklift accidents to a file with the command grep forklift [filename] > forklift.txt                                                                                        

6. How many accidents were on Christmas Eve? Also, save them to a file.
2
     I counted the number of forklift accidents with the command grep -c 12/24 [filename].
     I saved the Christmas Eve accidents to a file with the command grep 12/24 [filename] > christmas_eve.txt                                                                              
                                                                                            
7. I need a text file of accidents that involve trees!
Done!
     I saved the tree accidents to a file with the command grep tree [filename] > christmas_eve.txt.
    (I figured it was OK not to search for "trees" in addition to "tree" because results for "tree" would include its plural counterpart.)
